#### Abstract:
Cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated, less expensive to execute, dynamic and automated. The provision of cyber defense via statically configured products operating in isolation is untenable. Standardized interfaces, protocols and data models will facilitate the integration of the functional blocks within a system and between systems. Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. It should be understood that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated cyber responses that occur within cyber relevant time. Other aspects of coordinated cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.

# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a _Command_ is encoded by a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a _Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices. These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device. The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

## 1.1 IPR Policy
This specification is provided under the [Non-Assertion](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode) Mode of the [OASIS IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), the mode chosen when the Technical Committee was established. For information on whether any patents have been disclosed that may be essential to implementing this specification, and any offers of patent licensing terms, please refer to the Intellectual Property Rights section of the TC's web page ([https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/ipr.php)).

## 1.2 Terminology

_This section is normative._

* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g., 'deny').
* **Actuator**: The function performed by the Consumer that executes the Command (e.g., 'Stateless Packet Filtering').
* **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides additional information on how to perform the Command, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
* **Exclusive-OpenC2 Interface**: A device interface conformant with section 5.X of this Specification, ie that only contains only OpenC2 with no extensions
* **Extended-OpenC2 Interface**: A device interface conformant with section 5.XX of this Specification, ie that only contains only OpenC2 but includes valid OpenC2 extensions as defined in Section XX of this document
* **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.
* **Consumer**: A device that receives Commands. Note that a single device can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.
* **Device**: steal def from somewhere so include both physical and virtual devices
* **Interface**: steal def from somewhere
* **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received Command.
* **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target or Actuator to some level of precision.
* **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is performed on the Target (e.g., IP Address).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)] and [[RFC8174](#rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

* All property names and literals are in lowercase, except when referencing canonical names defined in another standard (e.g., literal values from an IANA registry).
* Words in property names are separated with an underscore ( _ ), while words in string enumerations and type names are separated with a hyphen ( - ).
* The term "hyphen" used here refers to the ASCII hyphen or minus character, which in Unicode is "hyphen-minus", U+002D.

### 1.5.2 Font Colors and Style
The following color, font and font style conventions are used in this document:

* A fixed width font is used for all type names, property names, and literals.
* Property names are in bold style â **'created_at'**.
* All examples in this document are expressed in JSON. They are in fixed width font, with straight quotes, black text and a light shaded background, and 4-space indentation. JSON examples in this document are representations of JSON Objects. They should not be interpreted as string literals. The ordering of object keys is insignificant. Whitespace before or after JSON structural characters in the examples are insignificant [[RFC8259]](#rfc8259).
* Parts of the example may be omitted for conciseness and clarity. These omitted parts are denoted with ellipses (...).

Example:

```json
{
    "action": "deny",
    "target": {
        "file": {
            "hashes": {
                "sha256": "22fe72a34f006ea67d26bb7004e2b6941b5c3953d43ae7ec24d41b1a928a6973"

```

## 1.6 Overview
In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 Messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:
1. **Producers**: A Producer is an entity that creates Commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the Command. A Producer may receive and process Responses in conjunction with a Command.
2. **Consumers**: A Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon a Command. A Consumer may create Responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the Producer.

![OpenC2 Message Exchange](images/image_1.png)

**Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications for Producers and Consumers to command and execute cyber defense functions. These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications. The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the language content and meaning at the Producer and Consumer of the Command and Response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.
* The **OpenC2 Language Specification**  provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for Commands and Responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the Command or Response.
* **OpenC2 Actuator Profiles** specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific Actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely to) implement multiple Actuator profiles. Actuator profiles extend the language by defining Specifiers that identify the Actuator to the required level of precision. Actuator Profiles may define Command Arguments and Targets that are relevant and/or unique to those Actuator functions.
* **OpenC2 Transfer Specifications** utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transport of OpenC2 Messages.
* **OpenC2 Interface Specifications** (this document) specifies how the OpenC2 language/actuator-profile/transport specifications define an OpenC2 interface that can be used for vendor-agnostic interworking between devices.


The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose Messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components. A Message consists of a header and a payload (_defined_ as a Message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and _specified_ in one or more Actuator profiles).

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the Producer, to one or more systems, the Consumer(s), to act on the content of the Command.
2. **Response**: Any information sent back to the Producer as a result of the Command.

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1-2 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude any particular approach to implementing the needed functionality (for example, the use of an application-layer message signature function to provide message source authentication and integrity).

![OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model](images/image_2.png)

**Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.

**Table 1-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>([[OpenC2-SLPF-v1.0]](#openc2-slpf-v10), ...) |
| Common Content | Language Specification<br>(this document) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>([[OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0]](#openc2-https-v10), OpenC2-over-CoAP, ...) |
| Secure Transport | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transport** layer provides a communication path between the Producer and the Consumer. OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transport protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transfer- and content-independent mechanism for conveying Messages. A transfer specification maps transfer-specific protocol elements to a transfer-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of Commands and Responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function. An Actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function. Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.

The components of a Command are an Action (what is to be done), a Target (what is being acted upon), an optional Actuator (what is performing the command), and Command Arguments, which influence how the Command is to be performed. An Action coupled with a Target is sufficient to describe a complete Command. Though optional, the inclusion of an Actuator and/or Command Arguments provides additional precision to a Command.

The components of a Response are a numerical status code, an optional status text string, and optional results. The format of the results, if included, depend on the type of Response being transferred.

## 1.7 Goal
specifies how the OpenC2 language/actuator-profile/transport specifications define an OpenC2 interface that can be used for interworking between devices.

The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD]](#iacd):

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions. OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guide the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and implementation agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  A Command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  Commands and Responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of Actions and Targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

## 1.8 Purpose and Scope
The OpenC2 Interface Specification defines the set of components to assemble a complete command and control Message and provides a framework so that the language can be extended. To achieve this purpose, the scope of this specification includes:

1. the set of Actions and options that may be used in Commands
2. the set of Targets and Target Specifiers
3. a syntax that defines the structure of Commands and Responses
4. a JSON serialization of Commands and Responses
5. the procedures for extending the language

The OpenC2 language assumes that the event has been detected, a decision to act has been made, the act is warranted, and the initiator and recipient of the Commands are authenticated and authorized. The OpenC2 language was designed to be agnostic of the other aspects of cyber defense implementations that realize these assumptions. The following items are beyond the scope of this specification:

1. Language elements applicable to some Actuators, which may be defined in individual Actuator profiles.
2. Alternate serializations of Commands and Responses.
3. The enumeration of the protocols required for transport, information assurance, sensing, analytics and other external dependencies.

# 2 OpenC2 Language Description

_The content in this section is non-normative._

The OpenC2 language has two distinct content types: Command and Response. The Command is sent from a Producer to a Consumer and describes an Action to be performed by an Actuator on a Target. The Response is sent from a Consumer, usually back to the Producer, and is a means to provide information (such as acknowledgment, status, etc.) as a result of a Command.

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command
The Command describes an Action to be performed on a Target and may include information identifying the Actuator or Actuators that are to execute the Command.

A Command has four main components, two required and two optional. The required components are the Action and the Target. The optional components are Command Arguments and the Actuator. A Command can also contain an optional Command identifier, if necessary. [Section 3.3.1](#331-openc2-command) defines the syntax of an OpenC2 Command.

The following list summarizes the main four components of a Command.

* **Action** (required): The task or activity to be performed.
* **Target** (required): The object of the action. The Action is performed on the Target. Properties of the Target, called Target Specifiers, further identify the Target to some level of precision, such as a specific Target, a list of Targets, or a class of Targets.
* **Arguments** (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
* **Actuator** (optional): The Actuator executes the Command. The Actuator will be defined within the context of an Actuator Profile. Properties of the Actuator, called Actuator Specifiers, further identify the Actuator to some level of precision, such as a specific Actuator, a list of Actuators, or a group of Actuators.

The Action and Target components are required and are populated by one of the Actions in [Section 3.3.1.1](#3311-action) and the Targets in [Section 3.3.1.2](#3312-target). A particular Target may be further refined by the Target type definitions in [Section 3.4.1](#341-target-types). Procedures to extend the Targets are described in [Section 3.1.4](#314-extensions).

Command Arguments, if present, influence the Command by providing information such as timing, periodicity, duration, or other details on what is to be executed. They can also be used to convey the need for acknowledgment or additional status information about the execution of a Command. The valid Arguments defined in this specification are in [Section 3.3.1.4](#3314-command-arguments). Procedures to extend Arguments are described in [Section 3.1.4](#314-extensions).

An Actuator is an implementation of a cyber defense function that executes the Command. An Actuator Profile is a specification that identifies the subset of Actions, Targets and other aspects of this language specification that are required or optional in the context of a particular Actuator. An Actuator Profile may extend the language by defining additional Targets, Arguments, and Actuator Specifiers that are meaningful and possibly unique to the Actuator.

The Actuator may be omitted from a Command and typically will not be included in implementations where the identities of the endpoints are unambiguous or when a high-level effects-based Command is desired and the tactical decisions on how the effect is achieved is left to the recipient.

## 2.2 OpenC2 Response
The Response is a Message sent from the recipient of a Command. Response messages provide acknowledgment, status, results from a query, or other information. At a minimum, a Response will contain a status code to indicate the result of performing the Command. Additional status text and response fields optionally provide more detailed information that is specific to or requested by the Command. [Section 3.3.2](#332-openc2-response) defines the syntax of an OpenC2 Response.

# 5 Conformance

_This content in this section is normative._

### 5.1 Conformance Clause 1: Exclusive-OpenC2 Interface

An Exclusive-OpenC2 Interface is conformant if all of the following conditions are met:

all commands and responses over the interface MUST be conformant with Section 5 of Language Spec

all commands and responses over the interface MUST be conformant with one or more Actuator Profiles defined in accordance with [Section X](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc)

all transport over the interface MUST be conformant with one or more of the transport specifications defined in [Section X](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc)

The commands and responses MUST NOT contain OpenC3 Language extensions in Section X of Language Specification. For example (example extension per section X of Language Spec) would be non-compliant. For example the capability to switch to other than JSON serialization would be non-compliant.

The commands and responses MUST NOT contain any functionality other that defined in Actuator Profiles defined in accordance with [Section X](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc). For example, custom actuator profiles would be non-compliant for an Exclusive-OpenC2 Interface (but could be compliant for an Extended-OpenC2 interface).

### 5.2 Conformance Clause 2: Extended-OpenC2 Interface
An Extended-OpenC2 Interface is conformant if all of the following conditions are met:

all commands over the interface MUST be conformant with Section 5 of Language Spec

all responses over the interface MUST be conformant with Section 5 of Language Spec

all commands and responses MUST be conformant with one or more Actuator or Custom Actuator Profiles defined in accordance with [Section X+1](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc)

all transport over the interface MUST be conformant with one or more of the transport specifications defined in [Section X](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc)

The commands and responses MAY contain OpenC3 Language extensions in Section X of Language Specification. For example (example extension per section X of Language Spec) could be compliant. For example the capability to switch to other than JSON serialization could be compliant.

The commands and responses MAY contain functionality other that defined in Actuator Profiles defined in accordance with [Section X](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc), buy that functionality MUST be specified in Custom Actuator Profiles in accordance with [Section X+1](fill in link to  (earlier section of this doc).
